FRONT END CAPSTONE - EMO-LOCATION

It’s time to get creative with CRUD.  Modularization, dynamic routing, state and props mean less code that works harder.  Seeing a project through from ERD to completion was as exciting as taking the training wheels off a bike.
Growth areas included: 
1. Creating meaningful issue tickets and employing them
2. Re-working issue tickets to meet unforeseen challenges
3. Enjoying a little fun with bootstrap

I started with a grid for REACT routing akin to the LA freeway system and finished with something closer to the Chicago Dan Ryan Express - Thanks to google, perseverance, and the many folk willing to explain things “just one more time.”
Best part was the opportunity to develop something I feel passionate about and daring to hope it makes a difference.

Emo-Location is a TO-BE list Emotion Tracker for those who want to live truthfully and move responsibly. It incorporates specificity and timeframes to challenge the  avoidance strategy of vagueness. Information relative to the 8 emotions encourages a better partnership between functionality and fully experiencing feelings.





This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
