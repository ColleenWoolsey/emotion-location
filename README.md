FRONT END CAPSTONE - EMOLOCATION

Creativity with CRUD inspired by Geolocation

Modularization and dynamic routing mean DRY code that works harder. This browser-based single page application employs React, HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript and Bootstrap. Seeing a project through from ERD to completion was as exciting as taking the training wheels off a bike.

Growth areas included: Flexibly balancing creativity and stretch goals with MVP and a firm deadline. Extensive project planning was done upfront with detailed issue tickets that allowed me to meet coding benchmarks.

I started with a grid for REACT routing akin to the LA freeway system and finished with something closer to the Chicago Dan Ryan Express - Thanks to google, perseverance, and the many folk willing to explain things “just one more time.”
Best part was the opportunity to develop something I feel passionate about and daring to hope it makes a difference.

Emo-Location is a TO-BE list Emotion Tracker for those who want to live truthfully and move responsibly. It incorporates specificity and timeframes to challenge the avoidance strategy of vagueness. Information and assessments relative to the 8 emotions encourage a better partnership between functionality and fully experiencing feelings.
